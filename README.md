The USGS provides earthquake data in a number of different formats, updated every 5 minutes. 
Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude.

Data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by their size and depth of the earth quake by color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
